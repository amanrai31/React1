# React1
Basics of react => 1.React-Dom(Web app) 2.React-Native(Mobile app)

### Framework(strict) vs library(cool dude)

### Why react-
For complex FE. There was no sync between state of JS and DOM if UI i.e. there ws no consistancy in UI.

### Topic to learn-
1. Core of react (State or UI manipulation, JSX)
2. component reusability (Components are JavaScript functions)
3. Reusing of component (PROPS)
4. How to propagate changes (HOOKS)

### Add-On topics-
1. Router
2. State management (Redux, Redux tootlkit)
3. BAAS(Backend as a service-  appwrite, firebase)
4. Poor SEO(Search engine optamization)
5. Other Frameworks
    1. NextJS
    2. Remix

### Create React app using-
Prerequisite- (VSCode, Node, npm i)
1. CRA(create-react-app)=> npx create-react-app <name>   --(App.js, index.js)
2. Bundler(Vite or Parcel)=> npm create vite@latest > name > framework > variant(npm i)   --(App.js, main.js)

Note :- reportWebVitals() in CRA is used for measuring app performance.
Note :- React uses JSX which needs to compile in JS using Babel.
Note :- JSX is extension of JS that describe UI in HTML like syntax.(Any f/n containing HTML is JSX).
Note :- If you are making a component make the extension jsx OR tsx - Good practice

#### Note :- This 01vitereact is in TS.
